## What did you work on yesterday?
I worked on getting boilerplate CSS down and modifying the HTML structure so it could be styled.
## What are you going to work on today?
Adding more complex CSS to make the website prettier.
## Are you facing any issues?
I'm facing issues figuring out the proper way to use the `:has()` and other combinators
## Is there anyone on the team you need to schedule a meeting with?
I should probably talk to someone with more CSS experience to figure out what I'm doing wrong and if my CSS is ugly
